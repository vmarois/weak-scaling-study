find the max number of dofs per core and set it as fixed for the rest of the study

'mpiexec -n 8 -bind-to user:0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ./demo_poisson --ndofs=124250 --xmlname=name'

Combinations of cores to study : 
4 bigs 
4 smalls
1+1
2+2
3+3
4+4

Phases to time : FunctionSpace, Assembly, Solve (Mesh is optionnal because it takes a lot of time)

Python script : reuse plot_study_one and the idea of iterating throuh a for loop with a list of the different cores combinations to study
Create appropriate strings to generate the command 
Run the command
Save to an xml
Generate the plot with pandas, matplotlib & seaborn

Do a GIT repo to save everything
